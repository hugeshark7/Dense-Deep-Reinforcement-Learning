<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
### D2RL Training Environment

Please refer to README_D2RL_Train.md for detailed information about D2RL training environment installation and detailed usage.

> Please note that D2RL training process requries a different python environment compared to the python environment in README.md, with different python verison requirements and different python packages.

# Usage

The project includes a data_analysis directory, which stores data (raw & processed), code (data processing and data analysis), and outcomes (figures) related to data analysis. The project analyzes various performance metrics such as time-to-collision, post-encroachment-time, bumper-to-bumper distance, crash rate, crash type, and crash severity. This section will focus on the post-encroachment-time (PET) analysis as an example, while the same procedure applies to all other performance metrics. Each performance metric analysis has a separate Jupyter notebook that contains its respective code.

> For jupyter notebook usage, please refer to https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/

Since generating raw data is a time-consuming process (e.g., NDE testing experiment requires 72,000 core*hours), we have included the data generated during our experiments for users to quickly replicate the results. There are three running modes available:

* **Mode 1 (recommended)**: [data analysis](#step3) using the data generated in our experiments;
* **Mode 2**: [data processing](#step2) and [data analysis](#step3) using the data generated in our experiments;
* **Mode 3**: [raw data generation](#step1), [data processing](#step2), and [data analysis](#step3).

> 1 core*hour denotes the simulation running on one CPU core (Intel Xeon Gold 6154 3.0GHz) for one hour. 

To provide further details of the three code running modes, a flowchart of PET data generation, processing, and analysis is provided as follows:

 ![File structure](./images/documentation_figure.png "Title")

## 1. <span id="step1">Raw Data Generation</span>


* **For Mode 1:** N/A
* **For Mode 2:** N/A
* **For Mode 3:**
  * Please run the following commands to run the simulation and generate the raw experiment results for Naturalistic Driving Environment (NDE) testing and D2RL-based testing (the experiment_name can be specified by users):
    * ```bash
      python main.py --experiment_name 2lane_400m_NDE_testing --mode NDE # Use this for NDE Testing
      python main.py --experiment_name 2lane_400m_D2RL_testing --mode D2RL # Use this for D2RL Testing      
    * By default, the simulation result will be stored in `./data_analysis/raw_data/experiment_name`.

## 2. <span id="step2">Data Processing</span>

* **For Mode 1:** N/A
* **For Mode 2:** 
  * Before running mode 2, the zipped dataset under `/data_analysis/raw_data` needs to be unzipped to the same directory. Please note that the total size of the unzipped files will be around 130 GB.
  * Run all the code cells in the jupyter notebook (click "Run all" button in the menu bar of the notebook)
  * The data processing code is stored in `/data_analysis/processed_data/`. For example, the code for processing PET for both NDE experiments and D2RL experiments can be found in the jupyter notebook `pet_process.ipynb`, including several major steps:
      * Load raw experiment results
      * Data processing: convert raw information (e.g., speed and position) to performance metrics (e.g., PET)
      * Store the processed data in `/data_analysis/processed_data/NDE` or `/data_analysis/processed_data/D2RL`
      * Newly generated files can be located after the completion of data processing:
        * `NADE_near_miss_pet_weight.npy` and `NADE_near_miss_pet.npy` under `/data_analysis/processed_data/D2RL`
        * `NDE_near_miss_pet.npy` under `/data_analysis/processed_data/NDE`

* **For Mode 3:**
  * In the Jupyter notebook, please modify the following codes to analyse the recently generated experimental outcomes:
    * ```python
      root_folder = "../raw_simulation_results/D2RL/" # Please change it to the position where you stored the newly generated raw experiment data
      path_list = ["Experiment-2lane_400m_IDM_NADE_2022-09-01"] # Please change it as the name of the folder generated in your new experiments
      ```
  * After the modification, users can follow the data processing section of Mode 2:
    * Run all the code cells in the jupyter notebook (click "Run all" button in the menu bar of the notebook)
    * The data processing code is stored in `/data_analysis/processed_data/`. For example, the code for processing PET for both NDE experiments and D2RL experiments can be found in the jupyter notebook `pet_process.ipynb`, including several major steps:
        * Load raw experiment results
        * Data processing: convert raw information (e.g., speed and position) to performance metrics (e.g., PET)
        * Store the processed data in `/data_analysis/processed_data/NDE` or `/data_analysis/processed_data/D2RL`
        * Newly generated files can be located after the completion of data processing:
          * `NADE_near_miss_pet_weight.npy` and `NADE_near_miss_pet.npy` under `/data_analysis/processed_data/D2RL`
          * `NDE_near_miss_pet.npy` under `/data_analysis/processed_data/NDE`



## 3. <span id="step3">Data Analysis</span>

> This step is the same for all three running modes.

The directory `/data_analysis/analysis_and_figures/` contains all the codes for data analysis and the figures generated. The file structure of the directory is shown below.
```
data_analysis/
|__ raw_data
|__ processed_data
|___analysis_and_figures
|______ crash_analysis
|_________ crash_severity_type_plot.ipynb # Analyze the crash severity and the crash type
|______ crash_rate
|_________ crash_rate_bootstrap_plot.ipynb # Analyze the crash rate, the convergency number
|______ near_miss_TTC_distance
|_________ ttc_distance_analysis_json.ipynb # Analyze the TTC, bumper-to-bumper distance
|______ PET
|_________ pet_analysis.ipynb # Analyze the PET
```
For example, the PET data analysis code can be found in `/data_analysis/analysis_and_figures/PET/pet_analysis.ipynb`, including following major steps:

* Load the processed experiment data from `/data_analysis/processed_data`
* Plot the PET histogram of D2RL experiments and NDE experiments, and then save figures to `/data_analysis/analysis_and_figures/PET`.
